# Changelog

## 0.4.0 — 2026-06-18

- Ship experimental `pi-cachemire` in the package alongside `pi-contextimate` and `pi-traceline`.
- Make `pi-traceline` rows unbanded by default, with the previous native tool-background slab available via `toolBackgrounds` config or `PI_TRACELINE_TOOL_BACKGROUNDS=1`.
- Preserve Pi's warning/yellow treatment for read `:line-range` metadata in single and folded read trace rows.
- Update docs and tests for the calmer traceline default and cachemire package inclusion.
